# Contributing

See the [README](README.md) for what the extension does and the endpoint chain it walks to find
reports. This file covers working on it.

## Development

```sh
pnpm dev              # Chrome, with HMR — needs an interactive terminal
pnpm dev:firefox
pnpm compile          # vue-tsc typecheck
pnpm test             # vitest
pnpm build            # pnpm build:firefox for the Firefox target
pnpm zip
```

`pnpm compile` and `pnpm test` are what CI gates on, so run both before opening a pull request.

### Testing against a real instance

`pnpm dev` launches Chrome with a **fresh temporary profile**, which is not signed in to your
GitLab. An anonymous request to a merge request URL redirects to `/users/sign_in`, so the extension
sees a path that is not a merge request and correctly does nothing. For anything involving real
data, use the production build in the profile where your GitLab session lives:

```sh
pnpm build
# chrome://extensions -> Developer mode -> Load unpacked -> .output/chrome-mv3
```

Then on your instance: extension icon → **Enable on this instance** → **Reload tab**.

Note also that `pnpm dev` waits on stdin for its `o + enter` shortcut, so it exits immediately if
started without an interactive terminal.

## Layout

| Path | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `entrypoints/gitlab-mr.content/` | Content script: detects the MR page, orchestrates the scan, mounts the widget |
| `entrypoints/background.ts` | Registers the content script for user-added instances |
| `entrypoints/popup/`, `entrypoints/options/` | Instance list and display settings |
| `lib/gitlab-page.ts` | MR URL parsing and relative-URL-root handling |
| `lib/gitlab-api.ts` | The endpoint chain in the README, artifact download, gunzip |
| `lib/reports.ts` | Normalizes the GitLab security report schema (v2 through v15) into `Finding`s |
| `lib/compare.ts` | Fingerprints findings and diffs the head pipeline against the target branch |
| `lib/scan.ts` | Three-phase scan: discover, download, then compare with the target branch |
| `lib/anchor.ts` | Where the widget is grafted onto the page |
| `components/SastWidget.vue` | The widget itself; `SastWidget.test.ts` renders it with `vue/server-renderer` |

## Injection point

The widget is inserted **before `#js-vue-mr-widget`**, the element GitLab's own MR widget Vue app
mounts into. That puts it at the top of the widget stack while keeping our node in the
server-rendered parent, which Vue does not manage and so will not patch away. `lib/anchor.ts` falls
back through `#widget-state`, `.mr-state-widget`, `.merge-request-overview` and
`.merge-request-details` for older or restructured layouts.

Styling is deliberately *not* in a shadow root: the widget reads GitLab's own theme tokens
(`--gl-background-color-section` and friends, GitLab 17+) so it matches light and dark themes, with
hardcoded fallbacks for older versions. Every class is `glsw-` prefixed to avoid collisions.

## Two identities per finding

`Finding.key` and `fingerprint(finding)` answer different questions and are not interchangeable.

`key` identifies a finding *within one scan*. It falls back to the job name and the finding's index
in the report, which is what keeps two unnamed KICS findings apart from two unnamed Semgrep ones. It
is what Vue keys list items on and what the comparison's status map is keyed by.

`fingerprint` identifies a finding *across branches*, and therefore excludes everything `key`
depends on that can differ between two pipelines: the job, the report ordering, and line numbers.
Using `key` here would report every finding in a touched file as newly introduced. See the comments
in `lib/compare.ts` for the per-report-type location rules and why matching is a multiset operation.

Two invariants the tests in `lib/compare.test.ts` pin down, both about not overclaiming:

- a report type the base pipeline has nothing readable for yields `uncomparable`, never `new`;
- a report type *our* pipeline could not read yields no `fixed` findings.

The presentation has the same rule, and `components/SastWidget.test.ts` renders the component to
assert it: the green check is only for a scan that found nothing. Findings this merge request did not
introduce are still findings in the code under review, so they hold the header at amber; new ones
take it to red.

## Releasing

Releases are driven by [uppt](https://github.com/danielroe/uppt) from Conventional Commits. Nobody
edits a version by hand; `.github/workflows/release.yml` runs three jobs across three triggers:

| Trigger | Job | What happens |
| --- | --- | --- |
| push to `main` | `pr` (`uppt/pr`) | Parses commits since the last tag, opens or updates a draft `release/vX.Y.Z` PR bumping `version` in `package.json` |
| that PR merging | `release` (`uppt/release`) | Tags the squash commit, cuts a GitHub release from the PR body, dispatches this workflow on the tag |
| `workflow_dispatch` on a `v*` tag | `assets` | Type check, test, zip both targets, attach the zips to the release |

`assets` takes the place of uppt's own `pack` and `publish` jobs — this is an extension, not an npm
package, so nothing goes to a registry. It is modelled on the submit step
[unsight.dev](https://github.com/danielroe/unsight.dev/blob/main/.github/workflows/release-extension.yml)
uses for its extension, wired to uppt's tag dispatch instead of a `package.json` path filter.

Two consequences of Conventional Commits worth knowing: only `feat`/`fix`/`perf`-style types produce
a release (`chore(deps)` is ignored outright, so dependency bumps no longer look like releases), and
while the major version is `0`, uppt demotes bumps one level — a `feat:` is a patch, a breaking
change is a minor.

The release PR body is the changelog, and it is editable: anything you write above the
`## 👉 Changelog` heading survives regeneration and lands in the GitHub release notes.

Rebuilding the assets for an existing tag is **Run workflow** on this workflow with the `v*` tag
selected; the zips are re-uploaded with `--clobber`.

### Store submission

Not wired up yet — releases are GitHub releases with installable zips, nothing more. Neither store
listing exists, so there is nothing to submit to.

To turn it on, add these repository secrets and two `wxt submit` steps to the `assets` job:

| Store | Secrets | Step |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Chrome Web Store | `CHROME_EXTENSION_ID`, `CHROME_CLIENT_ID`, `CHROME_CLIENT_SECRET`, `CHROME_REFRESH_TOKEN` | `pnpm exec wxt submit --chrome-zip .output/*-chrome.zip` |
| Firefox Add-ons | `FIREFOX_EXTENSION_ID`, `FIREFOX_JWT_ISSUER`, `FIREFOX_JWT_SECRET` | `pnpm exec wxt submit --firefox-zip .output/*-firefox.zip --firefox-sources-zip .output/*-sources.zip` |

The job already builds the sources zip AMO wants for review. Put the steps *after* the release
upload, so a rejected submission still leaves installable zips behind, and gate each on its secrets
being present (`if: env.CHROME_CLIENT_ID != ''`, reading the secrets into the job `env` first —
`secrets` is not available in `if`).

`pnpm exec wxt submit init` walks through obtaining the credentials, and `--dry-run` checks them
without uploading anything. One blocker for Firefox: the extension id in `wxt.config.ts` is still the
placeholder `sast-widget-for-gitlab@local`. It has to be the id registered on AMO, and
`FIREFOX_EXTENSION_ID` has to match it.

Two repository settings uppt needs: **Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests**
under Settings → Actions → General, or `uppt/pr` gets a 403 when opening the release PR. The `npm`
environment and trusted-publisher setup from uppt's README do not apply — there is no publish job.

## Store listing requirements

GitLab's [trademark guidelines](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/brand-and-product-marketing/brand/brand-activation/trademark-guidelines/)
govern what a third-party extension may be called. A Chrome Web Store or AMO listing must therefore:

- keep a name that does not lead with "GitLab" and uses only the `… for GitLab` or `GitLab
  Compatible` form — hence **SAST Widget for GitLab**;
- carry the non-affiliation notice at the top of the README in the listing's overview text;
- use no GitLab logo, logomark or wordmark, in the icon or the screenshots. The current
  `public/icon/*.png` is a generic puzzle piece.
